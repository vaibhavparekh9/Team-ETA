## Healthcare Monitoring System in an Autonomous Vehicle

A perfect autonomous vehicle is incomplete if it cannot take care of its passengers lest someone might face a medical emergency. Early detection of a health condition can result in a good treatment outcome, hence lowering the risk of serious health complications. In the case of a conventional vehicle, should such a situation arise, the driver can always take the necessary steps to ensure the wellbeing of the passenger. But, when it comes to an autonomous vehicle, this feature is missing and the health of the passengers goes for a toss if they face such a condition. To address this issue, the vehicle would contain an Automated Health Detection System to constantly keep a track of passenger health and accordingly adjust the vehicle parameters by taking passenger comfort into consideration.

The autonomous vehicle would have sensors like pulse rate monitor, blood pressure monitoring system, thermometer, oximeter, and so on. An advanced face recognition system would identify the age of the passenger and make necessary decisions accordingly. Additionally, the vehicle would also contain a holographic display where the passenger would input health-related information simply by marking checkboxes or by using a voice assistant. Based on the inputs given, results would be predicted using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. Furthermore, these results would be saved on the cloud for future reference and better decision-making.

To implement this, disease and symptoms related datasets were collected and cleaned by performing preprocessing and Feature engineering techniques. Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest machine learning algorithms were used for model training. A robust model was developed by combining all three above mentioned algorithms to achieve cent percent accuracy and perfect predictions. This newly created model was trained on the entire data and then tested on the test dataset.

A function was created to take symptoms as inputs and make predictions about the disease identified. According to the output, that is, the predicted health condition, necessary changes required in the vehicle’s driving pattern to ensure passenger’s comfort during the journey were printed. The autonomous vehicle would then take action accordingly based on the output commands with the help of interaction between the vehicle’s AI and actuators.
